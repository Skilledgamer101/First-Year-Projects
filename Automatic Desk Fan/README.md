# Required Materials

1. [Adafruit VL53L0X Time of Flight Distance Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3317)
2. [Hobby Gearmotor - 140 RPM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21245)
3. [SparkFun Motor Driver - Dual TB6612FNG (with Headers)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14450)
4. [Battery Holder AA x3](https://secure.sayal.com/STORE4/prodetails.php?SKU=251505)

I also used a [Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D Printer](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer-kit/). However, you don't need to buy this if you have access to a nearby public library or university with a 3D printer.
